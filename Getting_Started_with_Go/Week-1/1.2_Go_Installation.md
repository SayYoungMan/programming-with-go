# Go Installation

## Workspaces
* Hierarchy of directories
* Common organization is good for sharing
* Three subdirectories
    * src - contains source code files
    * pkg - contains packages
    * bin - contains executables
* Programmer typically has one workspace for many projects

## Workspace Information
* Directory hierarchy is recommended but not enfored
* Workspace directory defined by GOPATH environment variable.
* GOPATH is defined during installation

## Packages
* Group of related source files
* Each package can be imported by other packages
* Enables software reuse
* First line of file names the package

## Package Main
* There must be one package called main
* Building the main package generates an executable program
* Main package needs a main() function
* main() is where code execution starts

## Import
* import keyword is used to access other packages
* Go standard library includes many packages
* Searches directories specified by GOROOT and GOPATH

## Go Tool
* A tool to manage Go source code
* go build - compiles the program
    * Arguments can be a list of packages or a list of .go files
    * Creates an executable for the main packages
* go doc - prints documentation for a package
* go fmt - formats source code files
* go get - downloads packages and installs them
* go list - lists all installed packages
* go run - compiles .go files and runs the executable
* go test - runs tests using files ending in *_test.go*.
