- Must start with a letter
- Any number of letters, digits and underscores permitted
- Case sensitive
- Don't use `keywords`

## Variable
- Data stored in memory
- Must have name and type
- All variables must have `declarations` such as `var x int`
- Cant declare many on one line with comma

## Variable types
- Type defines the values a variable may take and operations that can be performed.
- Integer
    - integral values
    - Integer arithmatic allowed
- Floating point
    - Fractional values
    - Floating point arithmetic
- Strings
    - Byte sequences
    - Comparison, search, concatenation, ...

## Type declarations
- Defining an alias for a type
- May improve clarity
- Can declare variables using the type alias

## Initializing variables
- Initialize in the declaration `var x int = 100` or `var x = 100` (infer type from the given data)
- Initialize after declaration
- Uninitialized variables have a zero value

## Short variable declarations
- Can perform declaration and initialization together with `:=` operator
- Varaible is declared as type of expression on the right hand side
- Can only do this inside a function
