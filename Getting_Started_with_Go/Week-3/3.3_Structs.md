# Structs

- Aggregate data type - Groups together other objects of arbitrary type
- Example: Person Struct: Name, Address, Phone
    - Make a single struct which contains all 3 variables
    - ```go
        type struct Person {
            name string
            addr string
            phone string
        }
        
        var p1 person
        ```
- Each property is a field
    - `p1` contains values for all fields

## Accessing Struct Fields
- Use dot notation: `p1.name = "joe"`

## Initializing Structs
- Can use `new()`
    - Initializes fields to zero `p1 := new(person)`
- Can initialize using a struct literal
    - ```go
        p1 := Person(
            name: "joe",
            addr: "a st.",
            phone: "123",
            )
        ```
