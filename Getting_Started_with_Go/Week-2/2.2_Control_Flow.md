# Control Flow
## Control Structures
- Statements which alter control flow

### If Statement
  - expression condition is evaluated
  - consequent statements are executed if true
  
### for loops
- iterates while a condition is true
- may have an initialization and update operation

### Switch/Case 
- a multi-way if statement
- may contain a tag which is a variable to be checked
- Tag is compared to a constant defined in each case
- Case which matches tag is executed

### Tagless switch
- Switch may not contain a tag
- Case contains a boolean expression to evaluate
- First true case is executed

### Break and Continue
- Break exits the containing loop
- Continue skips the rest of the current iteration

## Scan
- Scan reads user input
- Takes a pointer as an argument
- Typed data is written to pointer
- Returns number of scanned items
