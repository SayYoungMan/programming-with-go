# Data Types

## Pointers
- A *pointer* is an address to data in memory
- & operator returns the address of a variable/function
- \* operator returns data at an address (dereferencing)

## New
- Alternate way to create a variable
- new() function creates a variable and returns a pointer to the variable
- Variable is initialized to zero

## Variable Scope
- The places in code where a variable can be accessed
### Blocks
- Sequence of declarations and statements within matching brackets, {}
  - Including function definitions
- Hierarchy of implicit blocks
  - Universe block - all Go source
  - Package block - all source in a package
  - File block - all source in a file
  - "if", "for", "switch" - all code inside the statement
  - Clause in switch or select - individual clauses each get a block

### Lexical scoping
- Go is lexically scoped using blocks
- b_i >= b_j if b_j is defined inside b_i
  - "defined inside" is transitive

## Deallocating Memory

### Deallocating space
- When a variable is no longer needed, it should be deallocated
- Otherwise, we will eventually run out of memory

### Stack vs Heap
- Stack is an area of memory primarily dedicated to function calls
  - Local variable is stored in stack
  - Deallocated after function completes
- Heap is a persistent region of memory

### Manual Deallocation
- Data on the heap must be deallocated when it is done being used
- Error-prone but fast

## Garbage collection
- Hard to determine when a variable is no longer in use
- In interpreted languages, this is done by the interpreter.
- Compiler determines stack vs heap
- Garbage collection in the background, which slows down a little

## Comments
- Comments are text for understandability
- Ignored by compiler
- Line comment: // 
- Block comments:  /* */

## Printing
- Import from the fmt package
- fmt.Printf() (fmt.Println) prints a string
- Format strings are good for formatting
- Conversion characters for each argument (%s for string)

## Integers
- Generic int declaration
  - var x int
- Different lengths and signs
  - int8, int32, uint16, uint64
- Binary operators (arithmetic, comparison, boolean)

## Type Conversions
- Most binary operations need operands of the same type
- Convert type with T() operation

## Floating Point
- float32 - ~6 digits of precision
- float62 - ~15 digits of precision
- Expressed using decimals or scientific notation
- Complex numbers represented as two floats; complex()

## ASCII and Unicode
- ASCII is a character coding - each character is associated with 8-bit number
- Unicode is a 32-bit character code
- Code points - Unicode characters
- Rune - a code point in Go

## Strings
- Sequence of arbitrary bytes
  - Read-only
  - Often meant to be printed
- String literal - notated by double quotes
- Each byte is a rune

### Unicode Package
- Runes are divided into many different categories
- Provides a set of functions to test categories of runes
  - IsDigit(r rune)
  - IsSpace(r rune)
- Some functions perform conversions
  - ToUpper(r rune)

### Strings Package
- Functions to manipulate UTF-8 encoded strings
- String search functions
  - Compare(a, b)
  - Contains(s, substr)
  - Index(s, substr)

### String Manipulation
- Strings immutable but modified strings are returned
- Replace(s, old, new, n)
- ToLower(s)
- ToUpper(s)
- TrimSpace(s)

### Strconv Package
- Conversions to and from string representations of basic data types
- Atoi(s) - converts s to int
- Itoa(i) - opposite
- Formatfloat - converts floating point number to a string
- ParseFloat - converts string to a floating point number

## Constants
- Expression whose value is known at compile time
- Type is inferred from right-hand side

### iota
- Generate a set of related but distinct constants
- Often represents a property which has several distinct possible values
  - Days of the week
  - Months of the year
- Constants must be different but actual value is not important
- Like an enumerated type in other languages
